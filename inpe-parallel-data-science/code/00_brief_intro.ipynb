    "## Very Brief Intro to Parallelism\n",
    "\n",
    "Why do we want to run code in parallel.  The high-performance computing answer has always been:\n",
    "  * __strong scaling__: solve problems of the same size faster\n",
    "  * __weak scaling__: solve bigger problem \n",
    "  \n",
    "In data science, there is another answer. Operate on problems that are to big to fit in memory.\n",
    "  * break problems into smaller independent parts that can be solved seperately on one node.\n",
    "  * spread problems across multiple nodes of a cluster to increase the total memory.\n",
    "  \n",
    "The opposite of parallel is __serial__, meaning that a program performs one step at a time using a single core.\n",
    "  * serial wastes power: the other cores are idle\n",
    "  * serial is slower\n",
    "  \n",
    "### And some jargon or lingo\n",
    "\n",
    "There are terms that I cannot avoid saying when teaching parallelism. So, let's define them up front.\n",
    "  * __core__ and __multicore__: modern processors (after 2005) have multiple independent processing units (cores) that execute independent tasks at the same time (in parallel).\n",
    "  * __shared memory__: the cores of a processor can see (read and write) each others memory\n",
    "  * __cluster__: a group of computers that are cooperating to solve a problem\n",
    "  * __distributed memory__: the computers in a cluster cannot see (read and write) each others memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why do I want to write parallel programs?\n",
    "  * to solve problems faster (strong scaling)\n",
    "  * to solve bigger problems (weak scaling and memory)\n",
    " \n",
    "### Why don't I want to write parallel programs? \n",
    "  * the tools are more difficult to use: expect 10x programming effort\n",
    "  * for many problem performance does not improve\n",
    " \n",
    "This mini-course will help to decide when to write parallel code and how to write it."
